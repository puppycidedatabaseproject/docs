Al Setikas:

"On April 29, 2015, after noticing a broken light bulb and damaged screen frame, drove to Wyckoff PD to report evidence of a potential break-in attempt at my home located at [redacted]. The dispatcher took my address and asked me to go back home and wait for an officer." 

Ferreira:

"On April 29, 2015, at approximately 15:45 hours I was dispatched to 621 Lawlins Rd. for a reported burglary. The time frame of when this occurred was said to have been quite a while in the past, like days. At the time I misheard the address as 622 Lawlins Rd., and echoed the address, 622 Lawlins Rd., back to dispatch without being corrected.
 
"I arrived on scene and parked directly in front of the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd. I approached the front door, and knocked for approximately 5 seconds. After hearing no answer, I attempted to open the door, which was locked. At this time I began a 360 walk around the house to look for any signs of a burglary."

Julie Pisani:

"While holding my grandson and looking out the family room window, I observed a police car pulling up across the street and facing south to oncoming traffic. No lights or sirens were on. An officer got out of his car and headed to the front of 622 Lawlins, then walked down the driveway towards the backyard."

Setikas:

"I returned home immediately and saw the officer pull up in front of 622 Lawlins Rd. facing into traffic across the street from my address. I then went to the driveway to wait for the officer to turn around and pull into my driveway."

Frank T. Muscara:

"I was proceeding on Lawlins Road heading towards [illegible] when I saw a police Explorer parked in my driving lane. I slowed down because I had to move into the oncoming lane to make sure no vehicles were coming directly at me. As I slowed down I looked all around and saw no individuals on either side of the street. As I passed the police vehicle I looked to the left to see the police officer just opening the gate to the rear of the property."

Ferreira:

"I opened the right side fence gate which was unlocked and walked around to the back of the house. At this time there was no indication of a dog at the residence. I observed no "beware of dog" signs posted, no animal feces or play toys in the yard. When I reached the rear patio, I observed an open window on the ground floor. The window was approximately 6 inches off the patio, and appeared to be the point of entry. At this time I drew my firearm since it was unknown if there were any suspects still in the house."

Pisani:

"He opened the approx. 6 ft. gate and entered the backyard. I then said to my daughter sitting on the couch, 'What is he doing? I hope he doesn't get surprised by Otto (a beautiful German Shepherd)."

Muscara:

"The officer was looking left and right before he opened the gate. He had no weapon drawn. The reason I slowed down was that I know the police officer because my son went to high school with him. I was going to say hello but I did not want to interrupt him from his duties. I then drove away and heard no dog barking."

Ferreira:

"I walked up to the rear patio door to continue my 360, and heard an aggressive barking coming from inside the house which sounded like a larger dog. I quickly stepped back, turned towards the barking, and saw a full-grown German Shepherd jump out the window and start charging at me in an aggressive manner. At this time he was less than 10 feet from me. I immediately sprinted in the direction of the side gate to try and escape, but only made it to the edge of the patio before the dog attacked me.

Pisani:

"Seconds after, Otto appeared barking and running towards the officer." 

Ferreira:

"The dog lunged and bit me on the right foot, latching onto my boot. At this time I thought that if the dog had brought me down, that it would have mauled me and I would have become seriously injured. I turned and fired my duty weapon which was still in my hand, while running towards the gate in an effort to protect myself from the imminent threat. I stopped firing once the dog started to run back towards the house and was no longer a threat." 

Pisani:

"The officer immediately took a strong stance and fired 4 to 6 shots. I saw one shot hit the dog and was hoping he just scared the dog. Otto turned and ran out of my sight and both my daughter and I heard a horrible cry." 

Setikas:

"After a few minutes I walked toward the front yard to see what was taking so long and from about 30 feet down my driveway saw and heard the officer fire his gun several times. I then heard the dog yelping and ran back down the driveway to check on my family.

"... From my position I could not tell which side of the fence the officer was standing but he was standing in what I would describe as a typical shooting position."

Ferreira:

"It was determined later, upon a weapon inspection by Sgt. Soto, that I had discharged a total of 4 shots. At this time I opened the gate and exited the rear yard. I immediately advised dispatch that shots were fired at a dog, at which time multiple units started to respond. When I was walking back up the driveway trying to catch my breath, I observed a woman, running across the neighbors lawn screaming, 'What did you do?' I advised her to remain back on the grass. At this time I examined my right foot and only observed one puncture mark on the right instep of my boot. Lieutenant Murphy and PO Noon then arrived on scene."

Wyckoff Police Lt. David Murphy:

"As I exited my patrol vehicle, I was immediately confronted by an unknown female party repeatedly yelling at me that the officer is at the wrong home. I explained to her that I just arrived on scene and I am not sure as to what exactly had happened. While I was speaking with her, I monitored a radio transmission from Officer Noon advising dispatch that 'All units could slow down as it was a dog and Officer Ferreira is OK.' I then completed speaking with the woman and moved down the driveway toward Officer Ferreira. I observed him to be very distraught and pacing back and forth. He was shaking his head and several times, he put both hands on top of his head. To me, he appeared to be visibly upset by whatever events had transpired prior to my arrival.

"As I was walking toward him, I could see past him and observed two areas on the dog that appeared to be bleeding. One was in the chest area and the other in his hind quarters area. There was also a visible blood spot on the ground below him. I immediately advised County Communications to have TYCO Animal Control respond as the dog was still alive. In an effort to monitor and notify TYCO Animal Control of any changes in the dog's condition, I maintained eye contact with the dog while I began to speak with Officer Ferreira about what had happened."

Pisani:

"Several other police cars showed up shortly after the shooting. The officer was very shaken up."

Setikas:

"Once they were OK I ran back to the front and yelled to the officer that he was at the wrong house. My mother-in-law also came out of the house and started to yell. Other officers then arrived at 622 Lawlins so we returned to our property."

Ferreira:

"After approximately a few minutes, TYCO Animal Control responded and took over care of the dog with the assistance of the dog's owner Mr. Igor Vukobratovic. They both transported the dog to Oradell Animal Hospital."

Murphy:

"I started by asking Officer Ferreira if he was injured or needed any medical assistance. Officer Ferreira stated that he did not and that the dog had latched onto his boot but, he was not injured."

Pisani:

"The dog never touched the officer."

Setikas:

"Lastly, a Wyckoff detective came to investigate the potential break-in evidence. I relayed some of these same facts to him at that time as well."

Ferreira:

"It should be noted that at approximately 1900 I was contacted by Kim from TYCO Animal Control who advised me that the homeowner responded to Oradell Animal Hospital and on more than one occasion, referred to the dog as her 'guard dog.'"
